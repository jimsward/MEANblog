<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a graduate of SFSU with a BSCS. Since then, I've spent two decades as a developer and serial entrepreneur.</p>
<p>My web-based skills include javascript, jQuery, Angular,<a href="public/app/images/MongoDB Certificate.pdf" title="mongo certificate"> mongoDB</a>, nodejs, and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.</p>
<p>I live and work in northern Sonoma County - about 80 miles from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Although I've taken several college courses locally in the last decade, I'm mostly self-taught.</p>
<h2>About this Blog</h2>
<p>This is mainly about the development process; particularly within the MEAN stack.</p>
<p>I like to approach things from a minimalistic perspective.</p>
<p>Each post should have a single topic, some info, and a date.</p>
