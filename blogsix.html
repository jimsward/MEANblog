<h4>AngularJS 2</h4>

<p>Anyone with any interest in Angular knows Angular 2 is somewhere on the horizon. As we approach the horizon the time has come to consider: At what point would it be wise
    to migrate to version 2?

</p>Looking at this from my point of view: It's too soon to even consider the changes involved. I started with Angular 1.2 about two years ago and am on 1.4.7 and looking at 1.5.7 in
the near future. Along with some enhancements and bug fixes, 1.5 is a transitional upgrade introducing features that will make a changeover to 2.x a little easier, while not making any
 monumental changes to our current code. And then: Angular has a tool - ngUpgrade - that helps you handle the next step; upgrading to Angular 2. I don't know how well it works. Adding yet another
step in the process seems to complicate things even further. But, if it works, the ability to change your existing code a little at a time sounds less stressful than doing it all at once.
<p>I remain quite satisfied with Angular 1. The only major flaw I've encountered is the way the digest burps when given a $apply from a source outside Angular - the "digest already in progress"
    error. Using $timeout to wait for a new cycle is a kluge, but it works.
</p>
<p>Using Angular 2 in a brand new project is a different story. I wouldn't hesitate to do so in about 6 months. It just got out of beta and the official release is still not available.
It has been my experience that being an earlier adopter is nearly never worth all the stress - and there will be stress - with the exception of evaluation and/or amusement. The
enticement to early adoption might be gains in speed and efficiency. For me, the trade off in dev time lost to bugs and learning something that's not yet stable is not worth it.
