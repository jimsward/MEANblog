<h4>Angular Material Untangled</h4>

<p>Angular Material, Angularjs' attempt to implement Google's Material Design Specification, involves a lot of directives, services, theming, css, and ancillary crud. The end product is
 for the most part, great; particularly the navbar, input widget, tabs, and toolbars. But, the API is extremely new and, so, less than stable.
    Which means a lot of extra work and/or workarounds. After seeing a few examples of their UI I decided it would be well worth the extra effort</p>

<p>The documentation, as with most Angular related APIs, is sparse at best. But, when I saw what it has to offer design-wise, I decided to discount the challenges and dig right in.</p>
<p>First, you'll need an Angular app you can use to apply ngMaterial. You'll need Angular to be at least version 1.4. The version number of the angular core file and the other required files,
    angular-animate.js, angular-aria.js, and angular-messages need to be the same and angular-material.js should be the latest release - currently 1.1.1. Troubleshooting: once you're sure you have no typos or errors
    in logic, look at version numbers as the most likely cause of unwanted behavior. Since the API is relatively new, you will most likely need to have a look at the source. It's all in angular-material.js.
    The code itself is fairly well documented. Expect to tweak your app some to get around some of the limitations and unexpected behavior introduced by ngMaterial.</p>

<p>The one thing lacking in ngMaterial is a set of directives for tables and their children. Since our accounting package makes heavy use of tables - check register, reports, customer data,
     invoices, all include tabular data - I looked around for something to get my tables to fit in with the rest of the site. I found two repos on github that address this issue: mdDataTable and md-data-table. Confusing?
    I looked at both. I was looking for well structured code and usability. I chose the hyphenated one; largely based on the ease of building the demo on my machine.
</p>
<p>For the most part, I am really happy with the results. Like I said, it takes some tinkering, but the result is impressive. We tested it on the three major browsers. I works well on
all of them. IE is much slower and not as pleasant looking. This may derive from ngMaterial's use of flexbox for layouts. This was my first real immersion in the flexbox technology.
 Although I was quite new to it, I found it really simple to learn and to use.</p>
