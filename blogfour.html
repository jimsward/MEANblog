<h4>A Catch-All MEAN App</h4>

<p>I have created a fully functional MEAN app currently in use as a catch-all for a defunct URL to give potential visitors to the defunct site a little info on the situation with the site and its business state..</p>

<p>It consists of a Home page, some links, a contact form that sends me an email and inserts the contact info into a database..</p>
<p>This can easily be extended as the need arises; making use of the database connection, email client, and a basic Single Page App structure.</p>
