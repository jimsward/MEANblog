<h4>Javascript: Functional Programming, Loosely Typed, Callbacks, and Closures</h4>

<p>As a seasoned Javascript programmer, I've spent some time in research, experimentation, and meditation on the connections between functional programming, loose typing, callbacks, and closures; all features of the language. Functional programming is the
     basic ingredient that makes this stew what it is. Of course the missing ingredient is classes. The functional paradigm makes JS' style of OOP work best without classes. The use of classes in some forms of OOP is just a variant of type casting. For better or
    for worse, JS is weakly typed. The heart of the matter: Functional programming gives Javascript its most powerful feature, closures, and therefore asynchronous execution. This gives us callbacks with closures to handle event driven apps succinctly and
    with minimal overhead.</p>
<p>Behind the scene, closures work their magic. A closure is an object with two properties : A function and the environment in which it was created. So the closure gives access to all the variables within its scope at that time by <em>reference</em>
So, any changes to those values are reflected in the closure and vice versa.</p>
<p>All of this leads to the Module Pattern, in which each module is a closure. We can, therefore only access from the outside of a module what is exported by the inside. This allows for more structured, readable, and maintainable code</p>
