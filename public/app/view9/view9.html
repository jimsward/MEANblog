<h4>A Landing Page/Info Site</h4>
<p>This is a transitional site replacing a dated and no longer accurate site.</p>
<p>It's basically meant for anyone looking at the old URL; so they don't end up confused by either the old site or a non-functional landing or 404 page.</p>
<p>It has some links and a contact form that takes the usual info and stores it in a database, then sends an email so I know if someone needs to contact us.</p>
